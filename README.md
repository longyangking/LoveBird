#LoveBird

##Description
LoveBird is a highly efficient FDTD computation system. There are some features it has:  
+ Robust computation
+ New types of materials such as chiral, hyperbolic and nonlocal optical materials supported
+ Self-adapted mesh grid
+ Script supported
+ Parallel supported
+ Powerful Post Process
+ Web Page Editor and Remote Editor  
+ Optimization based on machine learning

##Status
I'm a PhD of computational physics, which contains the research about the CS and physics.  
It will come soon but the process will be variant according to my schedule.
